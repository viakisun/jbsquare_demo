# JB SQUARE Demo Project

This project serves as a demonstration of two different design concepts for the "JB SQUARE" bio-cluster portal. It includes a landing page that allows navigation to each concept.

## Page Concepts

There are two distinct concepts available for preview:

1.  **Innovative Concept (`/jb-square-root-redesign`)**: A visually-driven, modern, and dynamic concept page. It features a futuristic design with fluid animations and a strong "wow" factor.

2.  **Editorial Concept (`/jb-square-f2-desktop`)**: A more traditional, information-rich, and functional corporate/platform website. It is designed to be comprehensive, prioritizing clarity and the effective presentation of data.

## Project Structure

The application is structured as follows:

-   `/`: The main landing page, which provides access to the two concepts.
-   `/jb-square-root-redesign`: The "Innovative Concept" page.
-   `/jb-square-f2-desktop`: The "Editorial Concept" page.
